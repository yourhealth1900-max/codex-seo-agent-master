Got it. Here’s a **complete, reusable strategy** (what to do + how to check) and a **copy-paste master prompt** you can hand to any writer/agent to produce a fully-compliant long article like the one we built—mobile-first, SEO-ready, SGE/AI-friendly, with schema, E-E-A-T, CTAs, and monetization.

---

# 1) Strategy — the exact playbook

## A) Goals & guardrails

* **Primary goal:** rank on the **brand/topic focus keyword** without cannibalizing existing posts.
* **Secondaries:** qualify for **Rich Results** (FAQPage), **AI Overviews/SGE**, and convert via **clean CTAs**.
* **No fluff:** zero padding/repetition. Every section must add new value.

## B) Inputs the agent must collect

* **Focus keyword (FK)**: unique site-wide (e.g., `CortiSync` not “CortiSync Review” if that’s used elsewhere).
* **Slug/canonical**: short, evergreen (e.g., `/cortisync/`).
* **Affiliate data**: buttons, banners, code (e.g., `.../ct/618161`), secondary products (CalmLean, DIM3X).
* **Internal links list**: 8–15 approved URLs with preferred anchors.
* **Medical team**: names + profile URLs for E-E-A-T box.
* **Brand tone**: clinical / commercial balance %.
* **Images**: at least 1 featured (1200×630), product images (with dimensions).

## C) Page structure (longform, scan-friendly)

1. **H1** with FK near the start (no year if evergreen).
2. **Answer-First** block (45–60 words).
3. **TOC** with jump links.
4. **Body sections** (unique content per section):

   * Mechanism & “where it fits”
   * Ingredient deep-dive (what/why/standards)
   * Dose & timing (standard vs conservative)
   * 30-day plan
   * Sleep protocol
   * Nutrition
   * Training/recovery
   * Stacks (secondary products)
   * Safety/contraindications matrix
   * Alternatives/compare table
   * Troubleshooting decision-tree
   * Metrics/checklist to measure progress
5. **FAQs (8–10)** — purchase, guarantee, dosage, caffeine, interactions, miss a dose, stacking, results timeline, measurement.
6. **Doctors (E-E-A-T) box** — 3–6 reviewers with links to bios.
7. **CTAs** — top/mid/end + sticky mobile bar.
8. **Resources** — internal links list.

**Word count target:** 4,500–6,500 words.
**Keyword density:** FK ≈ **0.8–1.5%** overall; never >2 uses per paragraph; use synonyms/LSI.

## D) Metadata

* **Title (≤60 chars)**: FK first + number + power word (no year for evergreen).
  *Example:* `CortiSync — 7 Proven Benefits (Science-Backed Guide)`
* **Meta description (150–160)**: include FK once + hook + benefit + CTA.
* **Canonical**: exact final permalink with FK (e.g., `/cortisync/`).
* **OG/Twitter**: summary_large_image + same title/description + featured image URL.

## E) Schema (one @graph only)

Include: `Organization`, `WebPage`, `BreadcrumbList`, `ImageObject`, `Article`, **`FAQPage` with `mainEntity`** (each `Question` has `acceptedAnswer`).

* Set stable `@id`s: `.../#webpage`, `.../#bread`, `.../#primaryimage`, `.../#article`, `.../#faq`, and per question `.../#q1…#q10`.
* **No Product Offers** if it’s editorial (use Product only if you’re the store).

## F) Links

* **Internal**: 8–15 dofollow to relevant evergreen guides (with specific anchors).
* **Outbound authority**: **15+ dofollow** (NCCIH, Examine, PubMed/PMC, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, NIH ODS, MedlinePlus, WHO, CDC, Sleep Foundation…).
* **Affiliate**: `rel="sponsored noopener"` on buttons/banners only.

## G) Mobile-first UX (non-negotiable)

* Paragraphs ≤45–50 words. Subheads every 150–250 words.
* **Responsive tables**: stacked on ≤640px (use `data-label` or JS to auto-label).
* **Images**: `width` & `height` attributes + `loading="lazy"`. Use WebP if possible.
* **Sticky mobile CTA** at bottom; hide on desktop.

## H) Distribution of CTAs/media

* CTA under hook, after 2–3 sections, and at conclusion.
* Insert **product-block** (image + short copy + button) after key sections (Formula, Sleep, Nutrition).
* Keep visual rhythm ~every 500–700 words.

## I) Compliance & tone

* **Medical disclaimer** present.
* Precautions/contra-indications section.
* No dramatic claims or diagnosis.

## J) QA checklist (before publish)

* Focus KW unique site-wide; in Title/Meta/Slug/Answer-First/H2 or two.
* Meta length OK; OG/Twitter set.
* **FAQ Rich Result**: validate (FAQPage has `mainEntity`).
* 15+ outbound authority links; 8+ internal; affiliates flagged.
* Tables responsive; images sized; sticky mobile CTA visible on phone.
* Lighthouse mobile score >85; CLS <0.1 if possible.
* Upload featured image 1200×630; ALT/Title/Caption set.
